# RDBParser

Nifty little code example to parse the RDB partition table on a hardfile (HDF) or device by path on linux (/dev/mmcblk0, /dev/sdx, etc)

## How to use it?

Run the project in your preferred IDE in debug mode, pass an argument to the path of the file, put breakpoints and inspect the partition table.

## Why?

I created this to fix an overlapping partition on my RDB partition table. And I figured since I figured out how to do it, it'd be nice to share.

## What for?

You're free to use this source code as you like to create whatever you desire e.g. HDToolbox for Windows, Mac, Linux or to make your own device-driver to put in Amiga ROM.

## License

I picked the MIT License so anyone can use this code in whichever project opensource, closed source, paid software etc. All I ask is that you credit the _**AmigaDev Team**_ and put a link to this repository.
